# FightingGame

A simple fighting game that is turn based.
The game is based on a python game: https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/the-warlords/
I have used only the game logic.

Build stages:
- One-on-one duel
- Army vs. Army battle;
- Full Defender army
- Vampire's kiss
- The Lancer strikes back
- Here comes the Healer
- One-on-one straight fights based on position in army
- Weaponize
- Revenge of the Warlords
